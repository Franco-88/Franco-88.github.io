     <h1>I am a Graphic Designer <h1>

     <p> Designing is not about creating advertisements, 
     but showing the world how vibrant the world 
     can be by just using digital art. I am based in 
     Queens, New york and I am here to make 
     your ideas come to life just like you expect it to 
     be. </p>
